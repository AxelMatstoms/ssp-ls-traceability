**Phase 2, step 2 Define Requirements for Simulation Models**

In step 2 "Define Requirements for Simulation Models" of phase 2 the framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill are clarified. Also, the requirements of the simulation task are broken down into the individual requirements for the simulation models. In the case of usage of the models in several projects or with partners also IP-protection has to be considered. This is an iterative process between all steps of phase 2.

**Process Execution:**
- Clarification of framework conditions, the relevant assumptions and the requirements that the simulation must fulfill
- Break down of the requirements of the simulation task into the individual requirements for the simulation models
