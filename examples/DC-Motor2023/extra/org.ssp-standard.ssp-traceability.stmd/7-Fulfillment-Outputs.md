**Phase 7 Fulfillment**

In this process phase the decision is made whether the requirements and objectives of the simulation task have been fulfilled. This is done in coordination with the higher-level process (Simulation-based Engineering Task). Further information available in the higher-level process can also be taken into account (e.g. results of other test tasks), as cross information of other test tasks of the engineering process can be useful input.

**Outputs:**
- **Decision about fulfillment of simulation objectives**
  - Fulfillment of objectives: The DC motor accelerates from 0 to 1000 rad/s in less than 1 s (simulation result: 0,9s) at 48 V applied voltage and a load torque of 1 Nm.
  - Evaluation with positive result of quality assurance of simulation setup and simulation results by simulation and domain experts.

- **Credibility documentation:**
  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
