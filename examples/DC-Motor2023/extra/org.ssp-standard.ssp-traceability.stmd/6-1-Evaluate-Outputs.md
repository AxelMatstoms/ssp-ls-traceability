**Phase 6 step 1 Evaluate Simulation Results**

In this process step the post processing of simulation results and for the quality of results is performed. That often means the visualization of simulation results according to the simulation task requirements.

**Outputs:**
- **Simulation results and quality of results post processed**
  - The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position). Voltage 48 V and load torque 1 Nm is applied. Simulation runs for 1.5 sec.  After 0.9 sec 1000 rad/s are reached.

  - **Procedure documentation with quality assurance**
