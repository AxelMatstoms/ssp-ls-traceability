**Phase 1 "Analyze Simulation Task & Objectives** 
Phase 1 "Analyze Simulation Task & Objectives" contains information and a description of the engineering task of the higher-level engineering process as well the general requirements and objectives, e.g. KPI and other criteria for the simulation task (see also 2.1).

**Inputs:**
- **General project information**
  - **Project name:** Mild Hybrid Variant AAA-55, 
  - **Project Number:** P987658, Subproject Simulation
  - **Version:** 2, 
  - **Project Leader:** J. Miller 

- **Engineering task**, development objectives and specifications of higher-level engineering process
  - A variant of a mild hybrid drive based on the DDC platform is to be developed. 
  - This application is a low cost variant.

- **Description of product, the requirements and environment** (meant is the environment of the real product, e.g. for car -\> road, climate zone, user group, frequency of use, â€¦)
  - The sub-task here is to make a pre-selection for a suitable DC electric motor in the early phase of the project. 
  - It is to be examined whether the DC motor with the type part number XY12346 is suitable in principle. 
  - Rationale: The DC motor type part number XY12345 is already used in automotive projects and meets the specific requirements for the application (temperature, vibration resistance, ...).

- **Simulation task and objectives**
  - Implementation and execution of a simulation based on a simple DC motor model. The effects which should be considered and neglected should be agreed on with experts.

- **Explanation why simulation was chosen as solution approach for the engineering task**
  - Rationale: Same approach in similar engineering tasks was performed successfully.
  
- **Quality aspects according to the criticality of the decision of the engineering task**
  - Potential risk and damage in case of misjudgement limited (additional development effort < 4 person weeks). Sufficient validation of the results and tools used by expert opinion and plausibility tests.
