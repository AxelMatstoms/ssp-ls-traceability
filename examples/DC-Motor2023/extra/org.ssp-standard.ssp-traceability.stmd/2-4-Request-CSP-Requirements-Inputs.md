**Phase2 step4 Define Requirements for Test Cases**

**Inputs:**
- **Requirements for test cases (the test cases or optimization criteria targeting the simulation objective**)
  - The simulation starts with all state variables 0 (current, speed, position). 
  - Voltage 48 V and load torque 1 Nm is applied. 
  - Simulation should run for 1.5 sec. 
  - Evaluation if after 1 sec 1000 rad/s are reached.

- **Specific quality requirements for the cases**
  - Assurance of the results and used resources by expert assessment and plausibility tests is sufficient.
