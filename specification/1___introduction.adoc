== Introduction

During the development of products, systems and components, design decisions often have to be made, e.g. to select or approve design concepts or to pre-select system components. Nowadays, design decisions are often made on the basis of simulations resp. simulation results, among other aspects that can influence these decisions. Usually an engineering project initiates and requests a simulation and addresses a simulation order to a simulation department or a simulation engineer. The simulation results then might be basis for design decisions.

Due to the fact that design decisions might determine the design of a product, a system or a component and determine or significantly influence further product development processes and costs, it is crucial that such design decisions must be based on a reliable information basis with a high degree of trust, especially if functional safety is affected and if the criticality of a simulation, that emerges these base information, is rated high.

In order to be able to make design decisions based on reliable information resp. on reliable simulation results, it is important that the underlying simulation task has been planned, performed, secured and documented in a transparent and comprehensible manner and that there is a high degree of confidence in the correctness and validity of the simulation results. This is not only important for making safe and reliable design decisions (__quality assurance aspiration__), but also to be able to understand such design decisions afterwards (__traceability aspiration__).

In addition, to enable and support the reuse of simulation results and simulation tasks or parts of the simulation setup, e.g. the simulation models or parameter sets, a comprehensive and as precise as possible documentation of the simulation task and the simulation setup is essential (__reusability aspiration__).

The enhancement of quality assurance, traceability and reusability is the core objective of the SSP Traceability Specification and the "Glue Particle" approach in the context of "Credible Simulation Processes."

*Disclaimer*

It is very important to recognize and understand that a high-quality documentation of simulation tasks consistent with the simulation process using STMD files as specified in this Modelica Association standard does not automatically lead to high-quality and consistent simulation processes and to credible engineering decisions based on simulation results.

A high-quality documentation of simulation tasks consistent with the simulation process using STMD files can maximally reflect the quality and consistency of the actually performed simulation task.

**Glue Particle Approach**

A Glue Particle is a tool-independet XML file that records or references all information nessecary to enhance the quality assurance, traceability and reusability of simulation processes and results. This is on the one hand the information handed over by the engineering project along with the simulation order to the simulation department or the simulation engineer. On the other hand it is all information having been used and generated during the planning, preparation, execution, validation and documentation of the simulation task, including references to externally defined and documented resources (external file or database references) and information on responsibilities, quality checks and approvals.

The XML Files for simulation tasks are called STMD files **(STMD: Simulation Task Meta Data)**. These STMD files can be used to inspect and trace simulation tasks, or to support the re-usage of simulation task or parts of a simulation task. They may also be used to describe simulation tasks that are assigned to service providers or delegated to development partners.

**Document structure**

Chapter XXX describes the general approach for the STMD files and the design of the referenced normative STMD XML schema. Chapter XXX describes the structure of STMD files in detail. Chapter XXX documents rules and recommendations for the handling of STMD files, i.e. the creation and use of STMD files. Chapter XXX specifies meaningful resp. recommended tool based functionalities that might support STMD handling use cases. Chapter XXX illustrates the handling and interpretation of STMD files using a simple and easy to understand instantiation example for a DC motor simulation. Finally, Chapter XXX provides a glossary of terms. **Die Beschreibungen der Kapitelinhalte mÃ¼ssen von Zeit zu Zeit aktualisiert bzw. zum Schluss ausformuliert werden.**

=== Credible Simulation Process

Considering that design decisions in the context of product resp. system development are made on the basis of simulations or simulation results, it is essential that the simulation results can be trusted and that it is possible to reconstruct how the simulation results were obtained. Finally, this can be summarized in the term **Credible Simulation Process** as illustrated in figure <<im-crediblesimulationprocess>>.

Typical applications of the Credible Simzlation Process are System Analysis, Optimization and Test. The Credible Simuzlation Process than only differs in some specific aspects. For
better readability, the **synonym "Test" is used for System Analysis, Optimization and Test.**

A simulation task in the sense of the STMD standard represents the entire credible simulation process, starting with the analysis of the engineering task from which the need for a simulation arises through the individual stages of simulation preparation, simulation execution and simulation post-processing until the decision is made whether the simulation results meet the simulation objectives and requirements and thus the simulation can be completed. Figure <<im-crediblesimulationprocess2>> shows the overall process with its individual phases. The phases of the credible simulation process are:

* **Analyze the Simulation Task & Objectives (Analysis Phase):** In this process phase the information from the higher-level engineering process is further specified and detailed with regard of the needed information in the following phases of the Credible Simulation Process.

* **Define Requirements (Simulation) (Requirement Phase):** In this phase the requirements for the individual components of the simulation and their interaction as well as the requirements for quality assurance are formulated in detail.

* **Define Design Specification for Simulation Setup (Design Phase):** The purpose of the Design Phase is to create all specifications needed to implement the complete simulation setup.

* **Implement and Assure Quality for Simulation Setup (Implementation Phase):** The purpose of the Implementation Phase is to implement the complete simulation setup with all its setup components as specified in the design specifications.

* **Execute Simulation (Execution Phase):** The purpose of the Execution Phase is to execute the simulation and to record the simulation reults.

* **Evaluate Simulation Results & Assure Quality (Evaluation Phase):** The purpose of the Evaluation Phase is to evaluate the simulation reults.

* **Decide about Fulfillment of Simulation Objectives (Fulfillment Phase):** The purpose of the Fulfilment Phase is to confirm that the simulation results fulfil the original objectives of the sululatino task.

Each of these phases can comprise several steps or several partial aspects of a phase.  For example, the Design phase comprises the following steps:

* Define Design Specification Simulation Integration
* Define Design Specification Simulation Models
* Define Design Specification Parameters
* Define Design Specification Test Cases
* Define Design Specification Simulation Environment
* Define Design Specification Quality Assurance
* Verify Design

Each of these steps is an activity of the simulation engineer with respective inputs and outputs. The outputs in turn are usually inputs for follow-up activities within the credible simulation process, except for the outputs of the steps in the final phase. For each of these steps there is usually a defined procedure according to which the work is carried out.

The information associated with an individual step can be subdivided into the following information blocks.

* Inputs
* Procedure
* Outputs
* Rationales
* LifeCycleInformation
* Classification
* Annotations

The STMD format is a data format desinged to store information associated with the credible simulation process and covers simulation task meta data for the entire credible simulation process with all phases and steps. An STMD file can be recognized as an implementatation of a Glue Particle for a simulation tasks in the sense of the credible simulation process.
