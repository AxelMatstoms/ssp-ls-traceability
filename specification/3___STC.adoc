== SSP Traceability Common

This chapter describes in detail the content and structure of the XML schema stc.xsd. The elements defined by the schema represent common concepts for ensuring traceability that are reused in many places of other XML schemas for the topic of simulation process traceability. The purpose of the extraction of these reused elements is to increase the flexibility and extensibility of the Glue Particles concept and to help to apply the Glue Particles concept to other topics in product and system engineering.

[#sec-lifecycleinformationtype]
=== LifeCycleInformationType

The LifeCycleInformationType element defines the structure and attributes of lifecycle information about the enclosing phase or step element.

Due to the inherent dependencies of lifecycles, lifecycle information at later phases will be dependent on lifecycle status of former phases to a certain extent:  For example, if the implementation phase is designated as having reached the status "Validated", it would create a contradiction if the requirements phase has only reached status "Drafted". Multiple lifecycle information entries can be present, in order to record the historical progression of the lifecycle status, however only the last entry in document order, which will also be of the highest maturity, will be considered valid for the current file contents, earlier states only recording historical data.

| scope          | Optional            | This attribute indicates the scope or level that a resource is specific to, i.e. whether the resource applies at a global, system, subsystem or component level.  The use of this attribute is optional, i.e. it should only be specified where it makes sense to give this kind of information.
| type           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD.  Therefore for resources that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the component sources.  For resources that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system). If the source attribute is missing, the resource is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise.
| master         | Optional            | This attribute, if present, indicates the original, canonical master source for the resource. If it is present, it indicates that the content provided via source attribute and/or Content element is only a copy of the original, canonical data, and this attributes provides the URI reference to that original canonical master data.

If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.  If markdown content is used, then the type text/markdown shall be used. 
| source         | Optional             | This attribute indicates the source of the resource summary as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as STMD, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of summary sources that reside  inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For summaries that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the summary sources.  For summaries that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the filesystem). If the source attribute is missing, the summary is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be resent otherwise. 
| sourceBase     | Optional             | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against: If the attribute is missing or is specified as STMD, the source is resolved against the URI of the STMD, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource meta data as a URI (cf. RFC 3986). For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD, if the sourceBase attribute is ot specified or is specified as STMD, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of meta data sources that reside inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For meta data that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the meta data sources.  For meta data that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system). If the source attribute is missing, the meta data is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise.

[#sec-signaturetype]
=== SignatureType

The SignatureType element defines the structure and attributes of the signature entity for a given step or phase.

[#im-signaturetypeschema]
.SignatureType element structure and attributes

The SignatureType element is structured by the following subordinated elements.

[#tb-signaturetypesubelements]
.SignatureType element structure
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Sub element name | Optional / Mandatory
| Content          | Optional 
| GElementCommon   | Optional 
|===

The SignatureType element is associated with the following attributes.

[#tb-signaturetypeattributes]
.SignatureType element attributes
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Attribute name | Optional / Mandatory | Atrribute description
| role           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the role this signature has in the overall process. It indicates whether the digital signature is intended to just convey the authenticity of the information, or whether a claim for suitability of the information for certain purposes is made.  In the latter case, the digital signature format should include detailed information about what suitability claims are being made.
| type           | Mandatory           | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource signature, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional            | This attribute indicates the source of the resource signature as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as STMD, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of signature sources that reside inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For signatures that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the signature sources. For signatures that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the filesystem). If the source attribute is missing, the signature is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise. 
| sourdceBase    | Optional            | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against:  If the attribute s missing or is specified as STMD, the source is resolved against the URI of the STMD, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

[#sec-contenttype]
=== ContentType

The ContentType element defines the structure and attributes of inline content of an entity. If it is present, then the attribute source of the enclosing element must not be present.

[#im-contenttypeschema]
.ContentType element structure and attributes

The ContentType element is structured by following subordinated elements.

[#tb-contenttypesubelements]
.ContentType element structure 
[width="100%",options="header"]
|===
| Sub element name     | Optional / Mandatory
| ##any                | Optional
|===

The ContentType is not associated with any attributes.

==== ##any

The ContentType may contain XML Elements of any kind, i.e. the STMD Schema provides the possibility and capability to code any kind of information regardless of what the STMD specifies. This mean the name, structure and attributes of XML elements enclosed by a contentType element is completely free.







[#sec-responsibletype]
=== ResponsibleType

The ResponsibleType element defines the structure and attributes of the responsible entry for a lifecycle entry of a step or a phase of the overall simulation task.
