== Overview of SSP Traceability

The SSP Traceability Specification consists of the following parts:

 * The Simulation Task Meta Data (STMD) file format specification, specifying how to store, retrieve and handle simulation task meta data.

 * The Simulation Resource Meta Data (SRMD) file format specification, specifying how to store, retrieve and handle simulation resource meta data.

 * Definitions common to these two file format specifications, that can also be re-used in other traceability contexts.

 * The SSP Traceability Packaging specification, specifying how to package STMD and SRMD data, as well as related resources into SSP.

=== Purpose and usage of Glue Particle

A Glue Particle does not store any version histories of simulation traceability information but does store one snapshot of simulation traceability information of a specific date and time. The only exception is the lifecycle information. A Glue Particle stores who and as which role had influenced in which way, i.e. drafted, accepted etc. the simulation traceability information within a Glue Particle and when the interaction took place.

=== Simulation Task Meta Data

In the sense of tracking simulation processes that have actually been performed, all relevant information about the simulation process should be recorded in the form of metadata. If necessary, these metadata can be evaluated at a later time in order to be able to trace simulation processes of the past.

The metadata for a simulation task is organized in an XML files called STMD files. The structure of STMD files is specified by an STMD XML Schema. The glue particle approach implies that IT tools and systems that contribute or use metadata can read and write STMD files depending on the situation. The STMD files are filled step by step with metadata by the IT tools and systems involved in the simulation process. The graphic in figure <<im-bild1>> shows this principle of filling the STMD files step by step.

It is important to understand that STMD files do not document the simulation process itself. The STMD data format is not a process documentation format. STMD files document metadata of process inputs, procedures, outputs, responsibilities etc. that are associated with the simulation process.  

=== Glue Particle Layout

The Simulation Traceability Glue Particle files are based on a generic traceability documentation layout that determines which descriptive elements are required to document simulation related activities in a transparent and comprehensible way in order to enable quality, traceability an re-usability. This layout is basically independent of the actual engineering activities described.

The high level Simulation Traceability Glue Particle layout with its overall structure and descriptive elements will be introduced and explained in the following.

Beside some general and partly technical attributes, which are valid for the whole Simulation Traceability Glue Particle, the basic structure consists of seven phase elements, which correspond to the phases of the Credible Simulation Process and an element General information in which information is summarized, which is also valid for the whole Simulation Traceability Glue Particle. The seven phases are

** AnalysisPhase
** RequirementsPhase
** DesignPhase
** ImplementationPhase
** ExecutionPhase
** EvaluationPhase
** FullfillmentPhase

In addition, the entire Simulation Traceability Glue Particle can be classified and annotated. All phase elements are subdivided into step elements, which have different names in each phase and also correspond to the steps of the Credible Simulation Process. Regardless of the semantic content of a step element, the step elements are all structurally the same. All step elements have the sub-nodes Input, Procedure, Output, Rationale, Links, LifecycleInformation and additionally elements for Classification and Annotations.
