SSP Traceability Specification
==============================

This directory will contain the final specification document.
For now it contains the two inputs for the final specification document:

 * The [manual][SSPTraceabilityManual.docx] document for the STMD format,
   and
 * an early [draft][SSPTraceabilityPackaging.md] of the remainder of the
   specification in terms of packaging and SSP integration.

These two will be merged in the near future into an asciidoc-based
overall specification document.
