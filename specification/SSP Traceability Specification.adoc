*Disclaimer*

It is very important to recognize and understand that a high-quality documentation of simulation tasks consistent with the simulation process using STMD files as specified in this Modelica Association standard does not automatically lead to high-quality and consistent simulation processes and to credible engineering decisions based on simulation results.

A high-quality documentation of simulation tasks consistent with the simulation process using STMD files can maximally reflect the quality and consistency of the actually performed simulation task.

== Introduction

During the development of products, systems and components, design decisions often have to be made, e.g. to select or approve design concepts or to pre-select system components. Nowadays, design decisions are often made on the basis of simulations resp. simulation results, among other aspects that can influence these decisions. Usually an engineering project initiates and requests a simulation and addresses a simulation order to a simulation department or a simulation engineer. The simulation results then might be basis for design decisions.

Due to the fact that design decisions might determine the design of a product, a system or a component and determine or significantly influence further product development processes and costs, it is crucial that such design decisions must be based on a reliable information basis with a high degree of trust, especially if functional safety is affected and if the criticality of a simulation, that emerges these base information, is rated high.

In order to be able to make design decisions based on reliable information resp. on reliable simulation results, it is important that the underlying simulation task has been planned, performed, secured and documented in a transparent and comprehensible manner and that there is a high degree of confidence in the correctness and validity of the simulation results. This is not only important for making safe and reliable design decisions (__quality assurance aspiration__), but also to be able to understand such design decisions afterwards (__traceability aspiration__).

In addition, to enable and support the reuse of simulation results and simulation tasks or parts of the simulation setup, e.g. the simulation models or parameter sets, a comprehensive and as precise as possible documentation of the simulation task and the simulation setup is essential (__reusability aspiration__).

The enhancement of quality assurance, traceability and reusability is the core objective of the SSP Traceability Specification and the "Glue Particle" approach in the context of "Credible Simulation Processes."

**Credible Simulation Process**

+ + + tbd + + + +

**Glue Particle Approach**

A Glue Particle is a tool-independet XML file that records or references all information nessecary to enhance the quality assurance, traceability and reusability of simulation processes and results. This is on the one hand the information handed over by the engineering project along with the simulation order to the simulation department or the simulation engineer. On the other hand it is all information having been used and generated during the planning, preparation, execution, validation and documentation of the simulation task, including references to externally defined and documented resources (external file or database references) and information on responsibilities, quality checks and approvals.

The XML Files for simulation tasks are called STMD files **(STMD: Simulation Task Meta Data)**. These STMD files can be used to inspect and trace simulation tasks, or to support the re-usage of simulation task or parts of a simulation task. They may also be used to describe simulation tasks that are assigned to service providers or delegated to development partners.

**Document structure**

Chapter XXX describes the general approach for the STMD files and the design of the referenced normative STMD XML schema. Chapter XXX describes the structure of STMD files in detail. Chapter XXX documents rules and recommendations for the handling of STMD files, i.e. the creation and use of STMD files. Chapter XXX specifies meaningful resp. recommended tool based functionalities that might support STMD handling use cases. Chapter XXX illustrates the handling and interpretation of STMD files using a simple and easy to understand instantiation example for a DC motor simulation. Finally, Chapter XXX provides a glossary of terms. **Die Beschreibungen der Kapitelinhalte müssen von Zeit zu Zeit aktualisiert bzw. zum Schluss ausformuliert werden.**

== Credible Simulation Process

Considering that design decisions in the context of product resp. system development are made on the basis of simulations or simulation results, it is essential that the simulation results can be trusted and that it is possible to reconstruct how the simulation results were obtained. Finally, this can be summarized in the term **Credible Simulation Process** as illustrated in figure <<im-crediblesimulationprocess>>.

[#im-crediblesimulationprocess]
.Credible simulation process
image::CredibleSimulationProcess.png[]

Typical applications of the Credible Simzlation Process are System Analysis, Optimization and Test. The Credible Simuzlation Process than only differs in some specific aspects. For
better readability, the **synonym "Test" is used for System Analysis, Optimization and Test.**

A simulation task in the sense of the STMD standard represents the entire credible simulation process, starting with the analysis of the engineering task from which the need for a simulation arises through the individual stages of simulation preparation, simulation execution and simulation post-processing until the decision is made whether the simulation results meet the simulation objectives and requirements and thus the simulation can be completed. Figure <<im-crediblesimulationprocess2>> shows the overall process with its individual phases. The phases of the credible simulation process are:

* **Analyze the Simulation Task & Objectives (Analysis Phase):** In this process phase the information from the higher-level engineering process is further specified and detailed with regard of the needed information in the following phases of the Credible Simulation Process.

* **Define Requirements (Simulation) (Requirement Phase):** In this phase the requirements for the individual components of the simulation and their interaction as well as the requirements for quality assurance are formulated in detail.

* **Define Design Specification for Simulation Setup (Design Phase):** The purpose of the Design Phase is to create all specifications needed to implement the complete simulation setup.

* **Implement and Assure Quality for Simulation Setup (Implementation Phase):** The purpose of the Implementation Phase is to implement the complete simulation setup with all its setup components as specified in the design specifications.

* **Execute Simulation (Execution Phase):** The purpose of the Execution Phase is to execute the simulation and to record the simulation reults.

* **Evaluate Simulation Results & Assure Quality (Evaluation Phase):** The purpose of the Evaluation Phase is to evaluate the simulation reults.

* **Decide about Fulfillment of Simulation Objectives (Fulfillment Phase):** The purpose of the Fulfilment Phase is to confirm that the simulation results fulfil the original objectives of the sululatino task.

[#im-crediblesimulationprocess2]
.Phases of the Credible Simulation Process
image::CredibleSimulationProcess_2.png[]

Each of these phases can comprise several steps or several partial aspects of a phase.  For example, the Design phase comprises the following steps:

* Define Design Specification Simulation Integration
* Define Design Specification Simulation Models
* Define Design Specification Parameters
* Define Design Specification Test Cases
* Define Design Specification Simulation Environment
* Define Design Specification Quality Assurance
* Verify Design

Each of these steps is an activity of the simulation engineer with respective inputs and outputs. The outputs in turn are usually inputs for follow-up activities within the credible simulation process, except for the outputs of the steps in the final phase. For each of these steps there is usually a defined procedure according to which the work is carried out.

The information associated with an individual step can be subdivided into the following information blocks.

* Inputs
* Procedure
* Outputs
* Rationales
* LifeCycleInformation
* Classification
* Annotations

The STMD format is a data format desinged to store information associated with the credible simulation process and covers simulation task meta data for the entire credible simulation process with all phases and steps. An STMD file can be recognized as an implementatation of a Glue Particle for a simulation tasks in the sense of the credible simulation process.






== Glue Particle Approach

=== Purpose and usage of Glue Particle

 + + + tbd + + + 
 
A Glue Particle does not store any version histories of simulation traceability information but does store one snapchot of simulation traceability information of a specific date and time. The only exception is the lifecycle information. A Glue Particle stores who and as which role had influenced in which way, i.e. drafted, accepted etc. the simulation traceability information within a Glue Particle and when the interaction took place.

=== Simulation Task Meta Data

In the sense of tracking simulation processes that have actually been performed, all relevant information about the simulation process should be recorded in the form of metadata. If necessary, these metadata can be evaluated at a later time in order to be able to trace simulation processes of the past.

The metadata for a simulation task is organized in an XML files called STMD files. The strcuture of STMD files is spefiied by an STMD XML Schema. The glue particle approach implies that IT tools and systems that contribute or use metadata can read and write STMD files depending on the situation. The STMD files are filled step by step with metadata by the IT tools and systems involved in the simulation process. The graphic in figure <<im-bild>> shows this principle of filling the STMD files step by step.

[#im-bild]
.Bildunterschrift
image::Bild1.png[]

It is importamt to understand that STMD files do not document the simulation process itself. The STMD data format is not a process documentation format. STMD files document metadata of process inputs, procedures, outputs, responsibilitiess etc. that are associated with the simzulation process.  

=== Glue Particle Layout

The *_Glue Particle_* files are based on a generic traceability documentation layout that determines which descriptive elements are required to document engineering activities in general in a transparent and comprehensible way in terms of traceability. This layout is basically independent of the actual engineering activities described. This means that it can be applied to mechanical design as well as to software development, E/E development, system development and simulation processes.

A glue particle documents a structured scope of engineering activities. The size of this scope depends on the amount and complexity of the activities described within a glue particle. The documentation of such a scope can also be done in several referencing/referenced glue particles files.

The traceability documentation layout with its overall structure and descriptive elements will be introduced and explained in the following.

*_Note:_* _The description of the traceability documentation layout is completely independent from STMD standard format._


==== General information

Each glue particle always has a chapter reserved for information valid for the entire glue particle, i.e. valid for all engineering activities described by a single glue particle.

==== Technical content structure

The actual technical content is organized in a generic three-level hierarchy structure. This structure contains engineering activity phase’s information on the first level and engineering activity step’s information on the second level (see figure). The structure and the naming of the phases and steps is derived from the process of the engineering activity described. Each step is broken down into a generic structure with a subchapter for inputs, procedure, outputs, rationales and lifecycle information valid for the step. These subchapter represent the third level of the generic three-level hierarchy structure. Lifecycle information might also be considered valid for an entire phase which implies, that the lifecycle Information is valid for all underlying steps of the phase. In this case lifecycle information is documented on the second level of the technical content structure.

====	Descriptive elements

===== Title

A glue particle and a structural segment on the first and the second level (phases and steps) within a glue particle always has a title. A glue particle can be recognized by its title. However, the title does not serve to uniquely identify a glue particle.

===== Identifier

A glue particle and a structural segment (XML Element) within a glue particle has an identifier by which a glue particle or the structural segment within a glue particle can be uniquely identified within a given namespace. In principle, an identifier can also be multi-part, e.g. a combination of two attributes or the specification of a given namespace and an ID attribute.

===== Short description

A short description in a glue particle and a structural segment within a glue particle serves to quickly recognize what the glue particle is documenting without inspecting the contents in detail. This can be, for example, a short textual description of the contents or a set of descriptive attributes by which you can recognize the contents or the scope and purpose of a glue particle.

===== Long description

A long description within a glue particle and a structural segment within a glue particle is the documentation of the actual technical content of a glue particle. It is thus at the same time the legitimation of the glue particle. Without a long description, the glue particle may lose its value or must inevitably be considered incomplete.

===== Lifecycle information

Lifecycle information in a glue particle and a structural segment within a glue particle can be used to control processes, but also to assess the formal status of the information of a glue particle. Lifecycle Information are lifecycle stage specific and comprises the lifecycle stage itself, responsibilities, signatures and checksums.

====== Lifecycle stage

The lifecycle stage itself marks the progress and the liability of an assessed information, i.e. engineering activity phase information and engineering activity step information.

====== Responsible

The responsible is, depending on the lifecycle stage either the person who created or edited the information (e.g. for lifecycle stage “defined”) or the person who set the lifecycle (e.g. for lifecycle stage “approved”).

====== Signature

The signature helps to prove that the person who is recorded responsible is actually authentic.

====== Checksum

The checksum should make it possible to determine whether or not the content of a glue particle has been changed after the checksum has been created by generating a new "live checksum" at a certain time and comparing it with the checksum stored in the glue particle. If these two checksums are the same, it can be assumed that the glue particle or the area of the glue particle being checked has not been changed after the checksum has been saved in the file.

===== Quality information

Quality information in a glue particle or a structural segment within a glue particle gives a statement about how high the quality of the information and the confidence in the quality of the information is. Unlike the lifecycle stage which is only a single label, the quality information can provide more details about the actual quality.

===== Administrative metadata

These are usually fixed attributes that can be assigned a limited selection of values. Metadata is used both to control data management processes and to search for glue particles.

===== Keywords or classifications

Keywords or classification usually are terms that can be used to describe content, but do not necessarily have to be predefined.

===== Internal and external object links / references

Internal links serve to avoid or reduce documentation redundancy within a single glue particle file. External links are used to link information that is distributed across several glue particles and to integrate or reference other external resources, such as specifications or procedural instructions.

[#sec-lifecycleinformationtype]
=== LifeCycleInformationType

The LifeCycleInformationType element defines the structure and attributes of lifecycle information about the enclosing phase or step element.

Due to the inherent dependencies of lifecycles, lifecycle information at later phases will be dependent on lifecycle status of former phases to a certain extent:  For example, if the implementation phase is designated as having reached the status "Validated", it would create a contradiction if the requirements phase has only reached status "Drafted". Multiple lifecycle information entries can be present, in order to record the historical progression of the lifecycle status, however only the last entry in document order, which will also be of the highest maturity, will be considered valid for the current file contents, earlier states only recording historical data.

It indicates whether the digital signature is intended to just convey the authenticity of the information, or whether a claim for suitability of the information for certain purposes is made.  In the latter case, the digital signature format should include detailed information about what suitability claims are being made.
| type           | Mandatory          | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource signature, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional           | This attribute indicates the source of the resource signature as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as STMD, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of signature sources that reside inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For signatures that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the signature sources. For signatures that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the filesystem). If the source attribute is missing, the signature is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise. 
| sourdceBase    | Optional           | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against:  If the attribute s missing or is specified as STMD, the source is resolved against the URI of the STMD, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

| kind           | Mandatory          | This attribute indicates the kind of resource that is referenced, i.e. what role it plays in relation to the particle being described.
| type           | Mandatory          | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.
| source         | Optional           | This attribute indicates the source of the resource as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD.  Therefore for resources that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the component sources.  For resources that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system). If the source attribute is missing, the resource is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be present otherwise.
| master         | Optional           | This attribute, if present, indicates the original, canonical master source for the resource. If it is present, it indicates that the content provided via source attribute and/or Content element is only a copy of the original, canonical data, and this attributes provides the URI reference to that original canonical master data.
| id             | Optional           | This attribute gives the model element a file-wide unique id which can be referenced from other elements or via URI fragment identifier. 
| description    | Optional           | This attribute gives a human readable longer description of the model element, which can be shown to the user where appropriate.

==== Content

For details of the the Content element structure and attributessee chapter <<sec-contenttype>>.

==== Summary

The Summary element provides an optional summary of the resource being referenced. The summary information is intended for human consumption to get an overview of the resource content without looking at the content itself.  The summary content can be provided inline through the Content element, or it can be provided through the source URI attribute.

|===
| Attribute name | Optional / Mandatory | Atrribute description
| type           | Mandatory          | This mandatory attribute specifies the MIME type of the resource summary, which does not have a default value.  If no specific MIME type can be indicated, then the type application/octet-stream is to be used.  If markdown content is used, then the type text/markdown shall be used. 
| source         | Optional           | This attribute indicates the source of the resource summary as a URI (cf. RFC 3986).  For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD, if the sourceBase attribute is not specified or is specified as STMD, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of summary sources that reside  inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For summaries that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the summary sources.  For summaries that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the filesystem). If the source attribute is missing, the summary is provided inline as contents of the Content element, which must not be resent otherwise. 
| sourceBase     | Optional           | Defines the base the source URI is resolved against: If the attribute is missing or is specified as STMD, the source is resolved against the URI of the STMD, if the attribute is specified as resource the URI is resolved against the (resolved) URI of the resource source.

| source         | Optional           | This attribute indicates the source of the resource meta data as a URI (cf. RFC 3986). For purposes of the resolution of relative URIs the base URI is the URI of the STMD, if the sourceBase attribute is ot specified or is specified as STMD, and the URI of the referenced resource if the sourceBase attribute is specified as resource. This allows the specification of meta data sources that reside inside the resource (e.g. an FMU) through relative URIs. For meta data that are located alongside the STMD, relative URIs without scheme and authority can and should be used to specify the meta data sources.  For meta data that are packaged inside an SSP that contains this STMD, this is mandatory (in this way, the STMD URIs remain valid after unpacking the SSP into the file system).
